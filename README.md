# Data Visualization Coursework Repository

This repository contains my coursework for the Data Visualization class. It includes projects created using Google Data Studio and Tableau. Each project folder contains detailed documentation, reports, and links to the live dashboards.

## Research Question

**How can individuals identify universities aligned with their academic, personal, and career interests?**

## Implementation

This question is explored from three perspectives:
1. International Prospect Student
2. Prospect Faculty Member
3. Employer

The analysis for each perspective is implemented using Tableau and Looker Studio (Google Data Studio).
