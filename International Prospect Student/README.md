## Research Question

**How can individuals identify universities aligned with their academic, personal, and career interests?**

This question is explored from three perspectives:
1. Prospect International Student
2. Prospect Faculty Member
3. Employer

The analysis for each perspective is implemented using Tableau, Looker Studio (Google Data Studio), and Power BI.
