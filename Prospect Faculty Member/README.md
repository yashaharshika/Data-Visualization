# Prospect Faculty Member

This project aims to create dashboards to help prospect faculty member identify universities aligned with their interests. The dashboards are made using Tableau and Looker Studio (Google Data Studio).

## Research Questions
1. How do faculty-student scores and population density across different regions appear when visualized on a world map?
2. What relationship exists between citation score and research rank among the top 10 institutes, and how are international network    connections and the presence of international faculty members influencing this relationship? 
3. Which universities stand out for having strong faculty-student scores, while showcasing only the top 10 institutes in each country?
4. Which universities demonstrate superior faculty rankings and international faculty scores, focusing exclusively on the top 10 institutes in each country based on international faculty score?
